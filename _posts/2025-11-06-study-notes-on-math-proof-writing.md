## 1.1. Deductive Reasoning and Logical Connectives 🧠

**Proof writing** in mathematics begins with **valid reasoning**. We often use **deductive reasoning**, where the truth of the premises *guarantees* the truth of the conclusion.

---

### **Example 1: A Valid Argument**

<div class="argument-box">
Premise 1: All humans are mortal.
Premise 2: Socrates is a human.
Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.
</div>

If both <span class="key-term">premises</span> are true, the <span class="key-term">conclusion</span> **must** also be true. This is a classic example of **deductive reasoning** and a **valid argument**.

---

### **Example 2: An Invalid Argument (Fallacy of the Alternative)**

It is crucial to differentiate between an argument where the conclusion *might* be true and one where it *must* be true.

<div class="argument-box">
Premise 1: Either it is raining or it is sunny. (R ∨ S)
Premise 2: Either it is sunny or it is cloudy. (S ∨ C)
Conclusion: Therefore, it is raining or it is cloudy. (R ∨ C)
</div>

This argument is <span class="invalid">invalid</span>. If it is **sunny** (S is true, R and C are false), both premises are true, but the conclusion (R ∨ C) is false.

---

### **Example 3: An Invalid Argument (Affirming the Consequent)**

<div class="argument-box">
Premise 1: If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (R → W)
Premise 2: The ground is wet. (W)
Conclusion: Therefore, it is raining. (R)
</div>

This is also <span class="invalid">invalid</span>. The ground could be wet because of a sprinkler—the conclusion does not **necessarily** follow. This specific flaw is known as **Affirming the Consequent**.

> The reason we analyze **validity** is to ensure our reasoning is **sound**. Invalid arguments, whether in math or everyday life, lead to false beliefs or incorrect conclusions.

---

### **Abstraction into Symbolic Logic**

To analyze arguments objectively, mathematicians <span class="key-term">abstract</span> complex statements into simpler, symbolic forms.

For the argument:
> Premise 1: Either it is raining or it is sunny.
> Premise 2: It is not sunny.
> Conclusion: Therefore, it is raining.

We can assign:
* **R** $\rightarrow$ "It is raining."
* **S** $\rightarrow$ "It is sunny."

The argument becomes:
<div class="argument-box">
Premise 1: R ∨ S
Premise 2: ¬S
Conclusion: Therefore, R
</div>
This is a **valid** form known as **Disjunctive Syllogism**.

### **Logical Connectives: The Building Blocks**

The operations like "or" and "not" are called **logical connectives**—the fundamental building blocks of logical arguments.

| Logical Connective | Name | Connective Symbol | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Negation** | Not | **$\neg$** | Before a statement (e.g., $\neg P$) |
| **Conjunction** | And | **$\wedge$** | Between two statements (e.g., $P \wedge Q$) |
| **Disjunction** | Or | **$\vee$** | Between two statements (e.g., $P \vee Q$) |

---

### **Applying Connective Symbols**

1.  Let **P** be "It is raining," and **Q** be "It is sunny."
    * Negation: $\neg P$ ($\rightarrow$ It is **not** raining.)
    * Conjunction: $P \wedge Q$ ($\rightarrow$ It is raining **and** it is sunny.)
    * Disjunction: $P \vee Q$ ($\rightarrow$ It is raining **or** it is sunny.)

2.  Grouping with Parentheses:
    Just like in arithmetic, we use parentheses to group statements and define the order of operations.
    * $(P \vee Q) \wedge \neg R$ means "Either it is raining or it is sunny, **and** it is not windy."

---

> Statements that correctly use connective symbols and parentheses (e.g., $(P \vee Q) \wedge \neg R$) are called **well-formed formulas** (or simply **formulas**).
