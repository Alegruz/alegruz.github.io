# Computer Graphics

The term **computer graphics** describes any use of computers to create and manipulate images.<sup><a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></sup> This includes 3D modeling, rendering, animation, and many more. In this course, we are focusing on **game graphics**.

Game graphics is a subset of computer graphics where the main focus is to create and manipulate images to be used for an interactive game. The term game graphics is a rather obscure in terms of a discipline. In both academia and industry, people would rather refer game graphics as "real-time rendering" as the main characteristic of a game is to be interactive. Real-time rendering is concerned with rapidly making images on the computer.<sup><a href="#footnote_2">[2]</a></sup>
