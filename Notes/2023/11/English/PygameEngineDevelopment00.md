# Pygame Engine Development Devlog 00 (2023.11.23)

# Introduction

Recently, I've been developing a pygame-based 2D game engine for fun. I actually did something very similar back in university to create a quick The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past copy with pygame, which was also quite fun. This time, I decided to create a real game engine that features editors and much more functionalities that modern game engines have.

These are the initial goals:

* The engine must be efficient
* The engine must be designer-friendly

Of course game engine development without a specific outcome-a game-always ends up with clueless objectives. The final goal of this engine is to be able to develop any 2D game, but for now, I am focusing on point-and-click type of a game such as "Papers, Please".

I will be posting devlogs for things I want to share such as:

* brilliant ideas
* implementing known ideas from books/papers/articles etc.
  * mainly from books like Game Programming Gems series, Game Engine Gems series, etc.
